# Reinforcement learning with five methods: DFS, BFS, A star, Policy MDP, Value MDP. 
python run_single_algorithm.py -s 5 -r 2 -m dfs  
-s means the maze size  
-r means the random seed of the maze generator  
-m means different kinds of method, including dfs, bfs, astar, policy, value.   

python compare_all_algorithms.py   can output the comparation charts.  
python compare_h_method.py         can output the comparation of different heuristic method  
python compare_mdp_parameters.py   can output the comparation of different mdp gamma value.
